Notes
-----

* I spent most of the time demonstrating the javascript side, with a heavy emphasis on MV*,
  since that's what I primarily do. I try to stay current with css, but I'm primarily a
  js + html5 guy, and it probably shows.

* I really should have just used a model in app.js -- not because the project needed it, but
  because I spent too much time explaining boring stuff in comments that wouldn't have been
  there if I'd just started with a real model.

* I'd forgotten how annoying vertically-centered text was. If this weren't a demo app I would
  go back and redo it using either display:table & table-cell, or (ideally) flexbox.
